# SACR-MC-Rig - Revision 7

Quite simply, SACR is a rig developed by Sakura for use in Blender in the creation of Minecraft Character based renders with a huge emphasis on a large feature package without the performance drawback typically associated with having all of those features.

Revision 7 contains many improvements and changes over it's predecessor, Revision 6. These changes include but are not limited to improved shape Keys, optimized mesh and drivers, return of full rig bone shapes, and a compltetely redone face rig mesh. All of these bringig SACR R7 back to it's roots, a super optimized, feature packed, and highly customizable rig that won't destroy your computer or render times as much as competing rigs.

## Future Plans

Revision 8 has begun the development phase, before the plan was to continue off of Revision 7, I later decided to completely rebuild the rig from scratch because there are some fundamental items I wanted to change in R7 that would be too tedious to change over otherwise. Instead of relying on the rudamentary property system that SACR has traditionally used since it's inception back in SAMR V1, Revision 8 will make use of a Python script to append and configure the rig. While this is the current plan, it is too early to reveal further details regarding the development. The overall goal of SACR remains, a lightweight, easily customizable rig, and I intend to spend as much time as necessary to ensure the rig and Python script is production ready before releasing the full rig to the public.
