# SACR-MC-Rig - Revision 7

Quite simply, SACR is a rig developed by Sakura for use in Blender in the creation of Minecraft Character based renders with a huge emphasis on a large feature package without the performance drawback typically associated with having all of those features.

Revision 7 contains many improvements and changes over it's predecessor, Revision 6. These changes include but are not limited to improved shape Keys, optimized mesh and drivers, return of full rig bone shapes, and a compltetely redone face rig mesh. All of these bringig SACR R7 back to it's roots, a super optimized, feature packed, and highly customizable rig that won't destroy your computer or render times as much as competing rigs.

## Future Plans

Plans for Revision 8 are in the works, however I am still unsure whether to continue off the R7 platform or rebuild the rig with a new architecture.
