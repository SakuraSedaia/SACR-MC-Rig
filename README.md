# SACR-MC-Rig
Quite simply, SACR is a rig developed by Sakura for use in Blender in the creation of Minecraft Character based renders with a huge emphasis on a large feature package without the performance drawback typically associated with having all of those features.

SACR R6, released 2 years ago on Blender 2.93 has recieved a minor refresh to clean up two main issues present on the rig for Blender 3.3, being non-functional materials and extreme lag. SACR R6.1 is still offered as Blender 3.6 changed the file structure of blender save files, making it impossible to open or append newer rigs such as SACR R7 in versions older than Blender 3.6.
