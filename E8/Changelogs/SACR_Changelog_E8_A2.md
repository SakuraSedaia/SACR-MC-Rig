Latest Stable: R7.3
Blender 4.5

Alpha 2

Due to the rig undergoing a rebuild from the ground up, Dev builds will not include every feature planned just yet. Expect some systems and features to be incomplete or completely missing.

Reason for a complete rebuild is to refresh and update the underlaying architecture to enable better support for new, planned features. Would not be surprised if I end up changing the Rig Name due to being a complete Refresh.

Some features added in this version are taken from other rigs, and combined into one singular rig that I can use. While I may not use the rigs due to various technical issues I have with them, Iâ€™ve implemented them on SACR so that I may use them in an environment where tech issues are my fault.

Reason this Dev Build does not align with Alpha 1 is because of the rebuild, and SACR R7.3 has come out since D8 Alpha 1, and a new UI Addon, Sakura's Rig GUI, is now standard use for SACR Rigs. Functionality of the addon will be integrated into the Rig as well.
